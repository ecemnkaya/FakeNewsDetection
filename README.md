Fake News Detection Project

Istanbul Bilgi University 2023 Senior Design Project

The term fake news refers to intentionally misleading or fabricated news articles designed to deceive readers by presenting false information as true. This study focuses on the problem of detecting Turkish fake news. Initially, a Turkish dataset consisting of 4,455 training examples, specifically curated for fake news detection, was examined and analyzed. Subsequently, the dataset was tested using five different transformer models, including ConvBERT, BERTurk, mBERT, and DistilBERT, and the results were evaluated. Furthermore, various classification models, such as LR, DT, RF, GBM, SVM, and KNN, were applied, along with techniques like Bag of Words, TF-IDF, FastText, and Word2Vec, to evaluate seven classification models. Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score were calculated to assess the models. Based on the obtained results, an interface was designed to present relevant news articles along with their data streams, informing users about the authenticity of the news. This study aims to highlight the significance of methods for detecting Turkish fake news and to facilitate users in accessing accurate information.
